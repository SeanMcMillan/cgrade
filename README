cgrade: C grade browser support
===============================================

The idea is to make sure crappy browsers get ONLY html; No CSS, no Javascript.

There are 3 parts:

The test -- tells us if a browser is up to snuff or not.
    this code will have to run in any browser that attempts to run it.
    it needs to run in head, without a body

    standards mode (document.compatMode = 'CSS1Copmpat') // the most basic test: elimiates ie5 and safari2
    Supports Css 2.1 selectors + inline-block // a much stronger test -- eliminates IE6 and FF2
    w3c dom event registration // removes ie < 9, but allows firefox 1
    something stronger? html5 support should be left to modernizr

The bootstrap loader -- pulls in a javascript file
    has to run in any browser that passes the test
    expect ie workarounds here

    should load javascript asynchronously, non-blocking.
    either a: one built, concatenated and minified file
    or b: a file that will then to the loading for the rest of the site

The FOUC evader
    before the body loads
        use css to hide any parts of the page that will be improperly styled
    after we're fully done
        remove those styles. -- client will have to call this.

    even pages that are progressively enhanced will want to use the FOUC evader to hide their "Use a real browser" message

    body class: no-js --> loading --> done/ready/user-supplied-class/nothing
    elemclass: loadhidden
    html.loading .loadhidden { display:none }


There are 3 outcomes:
    in a browser with no JS/js disabled:
        They see the plain page
    in a browser that fails the test:
        They see a plain page
        and no js errors -- code will have to work in ns2/ie3/j. random browser.
    in a browser that passed the test:
        page is unrendered during head processing
        troublesome elements are hidden to prevent FOUC
        (domcontentloaded/window.onload fires here?)
        js and css are downloaded and applied
        .loading class is removed / page is ready (user supplied)        


Ultimately, I hope that all 3 patrts will be small enough to inline them into the head tag of yuor page
